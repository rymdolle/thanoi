The Towers of Hanoi
===================

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of
three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide
onto any rod.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the
other rods, obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks
   and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

How to run
